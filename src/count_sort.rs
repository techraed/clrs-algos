//! Count sort. With some conditions has a O(n) time complexity.
//!
//! There is a [theorem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61330147/comparison-based-sorting-is-wc-min-time-nlogn-so-what-about-best-average-case)
//! that states that the best time in worst case for comparison algorithms is *Î©(n * log n)*.
//!
//! One of the main features of this algorithm is that to sort the input array you don't have to do any comparisons. The idea is quite simple:
//! - you count number of each element in the input array;
//! - you count number of elements less than some current element;
//! - if you have 3 elements less than the element `x`, then the first `x` entry in the input has a position `input[3]`.
//!
//! Count sort is one of the algorithms working with a O(n) time. Actually, it works for that with some condition on input data.
//! That is if we have 1) *n* elements where each has a value from range of `1..=k`, where `k` is the largest element of the input
//! and 2) *k = O(n)* , then we have *O(n+k) = O(n+n) = O(n)* time complexity.
//!
//! Should be mentioned that it is a [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability) sorting algorithm, which is an important feature
//! for some other algorithms that can use count sort, for example, [radix sort](../radix_sort/index.html).
