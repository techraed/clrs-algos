//! Quick sort. O(n*log n) in the best and the average case. In the worst case - Î˜(n^2).
//!
//! Quick sort algorithm is "in-place" algorithm which uses a partitioning procedure under the hood to perform sorting.
//! It should be mentioned, that the algorithm is quite effective, despite having a worst case complexity same as insertion sort.
//! That is because the average case doesn't have significant difference from the best case and often we face the average.
//!
//! Partitioning is the procedure that divides "in-place" the input into 2 areas. Elements in the first area are less then elements in the last area.
//! What's more, we recursively perform partitioning on each these 2 areas. So in the end we have guarantee that there is a sequence of areas of length
//! *N* which varies from 1 to input.length/2 and elements of the left sequence are smaller than elements of the right sequence.
//!
//! Obviously, recursion tree has O(log n) height. Each height requires O(n) computations - O(n) * O(log n) = O(n * log n).
