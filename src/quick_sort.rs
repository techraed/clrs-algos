//! Quick sort. O(n*log n) in the best and the average case. In the worst case - Î˜(n^2).
//!
//! Quick sort algorithm is "in-place" algorithm which uses a partitioning procedure under the hood to perform sorting.
//! It should be mentioned, that the algorithm is quite effective, despite having a worst case complexity same as insertion sort.
//! That is because the average case doesn't have significant difference from the best case and often we face the average.
//!
//! Partitioning is the procedure that divides "in-place" the input into 2 areas. Elements in the first area are less then elements in the last area.
//! What's more, we recursively perform partitioning on each these 2 areas. So in the end we have guarantee that there is a sequence of areas of length
//! *N* which varies from 1 to input.length/2 and elements of the left sequence are smaller than elements of the right sequence.
//!
//! Obviously, recursion tree has O(log n) height. Each height requires O(n) computations - O(n)*O(log n) = O(n*log n).

/// The core of the quick sort is partitioning. We can implement different partitioning algorithms, which should follow the idea stated in the module [doc](index.html).

    /// The main idea is that we choose the pivot value (which in current implementation is the last one in the array) and
    /// compare all the elements of the array with the pivot. If the comparing value is less then the pivot, it goes to the left
    /// subarray. Otherwise, it goes to the right subarray if it is larger than the pivot. All mutations are performed "in place".
    /// In the end, we place the pivot on such position that each of `(0..pivot)` is less than each of `(pivot+1..)`.
    /// Then we return to the basic sorting procedure the index of the pivot, which is next used to divide the array to subarrays in order to
    /// perform partitioning on them.

    ///
    /// The idea is the same, but has one significant difference with Nico Lomuto's version: we do not monitor pivots value. We actually don't care about
    /// placing it to some position. The main thing is to form 2 subarrays where values of the left one are less than values of the right one.
