# CLRS algorithms implemented in Rust
The repo has some of algorithms and data structures from the "Introduction to Algorithms" book. 

## Why?
One of aims here is to provide some rust code for beginners to get closer to the language by investigating a familiar abstractions. Therefore
I don't try to implement fastest, most optimized solutions, just ones which ease diving into language.

## Testing
Simply run `cargo test`.

## Docs
Build docs yourself simply running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`.
